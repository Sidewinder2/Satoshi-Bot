# Satoshi-Bot
Plays Games to Earn Satoshi

Dependencies:
- Python + Selenium
- Google Chrome

This bot goes on a site known as a bitcoin faucet, earning small amounts of income by playing games nonstop. It's designed to be as unobtrusive as possible on the user and will automatically:

- Place Max Bet for fastest returns
- Generate Income Reports
- Mute the browser
- Block ads and the site's javascript based bitcoin miner using uBlock, ensuring the site does not take over your CPU or your attention
- Bypass CAPTCHAs, making it able to run indefinitely if desired
- Randomly sleep to appear more human and less likely to be banned
